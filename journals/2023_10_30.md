	- Current plan
		- train model that takes sequences of pedestrians' gaits as input, and estimate the emotion and future trajectories of pedestrians.
		- however, there are lack of dataset (multiple pedestrians in one scene) with gait as feature and emotion as label.
		- therefore, [[knowledge distillation]] could be implemented, to transfer the knowledge of a gait-emotion model, to a gait-interaction-emotion model.

	- Future plan
		- implement [[preference learning]] to achieve active lifelong learning of socially-aware navigation policy based on pedestrians' feedback.
