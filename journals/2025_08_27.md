	- Functional near-infrared spectroscopy is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique that uses near-infrared light to measure cortical hemodynamic changes by quantifying changes in oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) concentrations. Due to variations in the hemodynamic response across individuals and brain regions, hemodynamic response function (HRF) models that assume a fixed shape often fail to detect cortical activation reliably. To address this, we propose a novel approach that incorporates fully parametric HRF modeling for each individual and measurement channel, employing broad HRF parameter bounds to maximize adaptability to individual and brain region-specific hemodynamics. The model parameters were estimated via particle swarm optimization to resist entrapment in local minima even under broad bounds. To ensure physiological plausibility and mitigate overfitting, we introduce a regularization scheme that enforces positive peaks for HbO and negative peaks for HbR, thereby systematically rejecting insensible HRF shapes. We evaluated our method against seven established baseline approaches using a block‑design dataset collected from the prefrontal cortex of 37 participants performing a working memory task. The proposed approach demonstrates superior sensitivity and specificity, as it reliably detects positive HbO and negative HbR activations in expected task-evoked brain regions while preserving the typical inverse relationship between HbO and HbR signals. Our adaptive HRF framework embraces hemodynamic variability and harnesses both HbO and HbR dynamics to deliver individualized, physiologically grounded activation detection, thus advancing fNIRS toward clinical translation.
