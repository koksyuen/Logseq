- [[Meeting with Dr Lim Lam Ghai]]
	- My theory:
		- using [[particle swarm optimization]] to optimize [[vector phase analysis]]
		- Objective function:
			- since task-block average is the significant indicator for activation level, objective function only tend to increase task-block average, but still obey [[VPA]] (which justify that still removes blocks based on baseline return)
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- objective function tend to ensure HbO signal return to baseline at the end of rest period, but still obey [[VPA]] (which justify that still removes blocks based on baseline return)
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- objective function only tend to make HbO signal to looks like a [[hemodynamic response function]] , but still obey [[VPA]] (which justify that still removes blocks based on baseline return)
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
