	- In response to the problem of workload overload leading to decreased task performance during aerial combat missions, considering the characteristics of complexity and parallel operations in such missions, a quantitative workload assessment model is proposed based on the multi-resource theory and time-hierarchical task analysis method. The model incorporates a multi-channel conflict coefficient, which is quantitatively introduced based on empirical data and expert ratings from flight personnel, enabling the quantification of workload assessment for pilots. By combining three typical simulated aerial combat missions involving detection, attack, and evasion, the quantitative workload assessment results are presented. The effectiveness of the workload assessment model is validated through various methods, including three classic scales and task performance evaluation. The results indicate that the quantitative assessment model exhibits better adaptability and confidence under complex parallel task conditions, and further verify the contribution of conflicting resource demands to workload and the sensitivity of time resource consumption to different task difficulties in complex parallel task conditions.
