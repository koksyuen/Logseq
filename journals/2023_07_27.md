- stable baseline3 DQN
	- **batch_size** (int) – Minibatch size for each gradient update
	- **train_freq** (Union[int, Tuple[int, str]]) – Update the model every train_freq steps. Alternatively pass a tuple of frequency and unit like (5, "step") or (2, "episode").
		- (12, "step")
	- **gradient_steps** (int) – How many gradient steps to do after each rollout (see train_freq) Set to -1 means to do as many gradient steps as steps done in the environment during the rollout.
		- more than 1
	- **stats_window_size** (int) – Window size for the rollout logging, specifying the number of episodes to average the reported success rate, mean episode length, and mean reward over
