		- I have participated in Undergraduate Research Scheme with assist PhD student in his research with project title of Machine Learning for Robotic Vision. The project focused on development of an optimizers that aids in model training and development of object detector for a service robot. Besides, I have completed my Final Year Project with collaboration with Northwestern Polytechnical University, China with project title of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for Mobile Robot at Indoor Environment. During my undergraduate study, I also conducted my internship at HelloWorld Robotics, Malaysia, which tasked with development of autonomous outdoor food delivering robot. Moreover, I have participated in various robot competitions and won some awards such as second place in RoboCup Asia-Pacific 2021 Aichi Japan and third place in Robocup@Home Education Online Challenge 2021.
