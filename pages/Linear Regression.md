- Steps:
	- use [[least square]] to fit a line to the data
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- calculate [[R-square]]
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- [[p-value]] is calculated to determine if [[R-square]] value is statistically significant
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- [[Robust Regression]] is less sensitive to outliers than standard linear regression.
