		- \(\theta\) is the **target parameter** that we would like to estimate.
		- \(P(data|\theta)\) is [[likelihood]] of \(\theta\) based on sampling (\(data\))
		- \(P(data)\) is just a **normalizing constant** to ensure  the total of \(P(data|\theta)\) remains zero.
			- it is just the total product of \(P(data∣\theta_i​)\) and \(P(\theta_i​)\)
			  $$P(data)=∑_i​P(data∣\theta_i​)P(\theta_i​)$$

	- {{youtube-timestamp 1354}}  How to determine the weightage of [[likelihood]] and [[prior]] when calculating [[posterior]]
		- weightage of [[likelihood]] increase when sample size increase
		- weightage of [[likelihood]] and [[prior]] will increase if their respective variance decrease
